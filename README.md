# Leaflet-Challenge
  The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization:

Imported and displayed the data by using Leaflet, created a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

Created a function to reflect on the markers the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

Created a legend that will provide context for the map data.
